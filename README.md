# examples-of-using-cutie
For video tutorial where I explain features of cutie lib and what kind of thing you can do with it in general (video is in progress)

Plan for the video:

1. Explaining a bit problems with callbacks, Promises and async/await (on fs module)
2. Explaing ideas of declarative programming (abstract example)
3. Idea of async objects as a solution for the callback hell problem (on fs module)
4. Examples (ParsedJSON, cutie-assert, cutie-rest, simple-oauth-app)

2nd video:

Features of the `AsyncObject`
