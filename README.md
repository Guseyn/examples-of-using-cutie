# examples-of-using-cutie
For video tutorial where I explain features of cutie lib and what kind of thing you can do with it in general (video is in progress)

Plan for the video:

1. Explaining a bit problems with callbacks, Promises and async/await (on fs module)
2. Explaing ideas of declarative programming (abstract example)
3. Idea of async objects as a solution for the callback hell problem (on fs module)
4. Features of the `AsyncObject`
5. Examples (ParsedJSON, cutie-assert, cutie-rest)
6. As and after conceptions
7. Creating objects in the async way (cutie-created)
